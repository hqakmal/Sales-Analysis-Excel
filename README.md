## Final Conclusion:
To increase the company’s sales, the marketing strategy plan focuses on aged 28-37. This demographic is a key consumer segment, as they often make significant household and lifestyle purchases. Marketing focus should also be given to the $500 price point, which is the heart of the company’s sales. The approach should include targeted digital marketing campaigns and personalized promotions to capture their attention.
